# BankingProject (Archived)

This is an old, archived project of a banking web-app I was making in my 5th semester. It is incomplete and devoid of any working backend.

## Redirection
Refer to the [CentralBank](https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/CentralBank) repository. 

It contains everything this archived project has, and more, with a working backend written in Django, along with detailed instructions on how to use the app.
